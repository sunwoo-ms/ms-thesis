    abstract={As the presence of online and hybrid coursework at institutions of higher education has increased, so too has interest among educators and scholars in understanding personal and contextual factors that predict success in different types of learning environments. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relations among temporally-ordered variables, including beginning-semester self-efficacy, utility value, and relevance of instruction, mid-semester emotions (hope, frustration, and anxiety), and end-of-semester learning strategies in a sample of 291 graduate students (N=219 for the traditional education group and N=72 for the distance education group) enrolled in an introductory research methods course. Multigroup path analyses were performed to test the equality of path coefficients among the two groups. Results demonstrate that the groups differed with respect to several paths, including the paths from: extrinsic utility value to anxiety and to hope; relevance to hope; and frustration and anxiety to learning strategies. Implications for research, theory, and practice are discussed.}

This study examined the issues of student perception toward online learning and face-to-face learning in the context of social presence, social interaction, and satisfaction in Indonesia Open University, Taiwan branch (n=107). The comparison of the online group and the face-to-face group conducted to explore student-learning perceptions regardless of the course delivery method and the online environment. The result of this study indicate that face-to-face learning perception was higher than online learning in term of social presence, social interaction, and satisfaction. However, there is no statistically significant difference in learning preference found among level of student. Meanwhile, some students were very comfortable in online learning since it led them to the chance to being innovative by using computer technology.}

    abstract={Distance learning is different from regular learning in the classroom. One of the main factors which influence the effectiveness of the learning process is the interaction that exists between the teacher and the student. Our research indicates that different interactions have different effects. There are two methods used for implementing distance learning systems, i.e. synchronous and asynchronous. Our research is based on the model developed by Oliver and McLaughlin. According to this model, there exist five types of teacher–student interactions: social, procedural, expository, explanatory and cognitive. The present study refers to the cognitive interaction and differentiates between surface processes and deep processes. The study presents different variables and their influences on the students’ achievements and their satisfaction from learning via a synchronous versus an asynchronous distance learning system. The interaction level between the students and the teacher and among the students was found to be a significant factor in determining the effectiveness of the teaching method. The observations and interviews which we held with the students helped clarify the information that was obtained using the quantitative research tools, and showed that the presence of a teacher–student interaction which accompanies the learning process is very important for all learners. However, students with high-level thinking can overcome the low-level of interactions in asynchronous learning.}

The hypothesis was: Students' will perceive a positive impact on their learning and satisfaction, given the opportunity for web-conferencing in a synchronous model with interaction between the professor and the students in online classes. The results of the data analysis were 4.07 for the synchronous versus 3.92 for asynchronous. Students' perception indicated that the synchronous model was more effective and positive for their learning. Based on the results of the study a recommendation for a multi-dimensional, multi-faceted curriculum that includes professor's real-time presence to create an atmosphere of trust, guidance and openness among students is affirmed. These events should be video-taped and made available throughout the course for students review.},

    abstract={To address the increasing enrollment in Computer Science (CS), face-to-face (F2F) courses are often redesigned to online courses. For the success of a large-enrollment online CS class, it is important to design it with effective strategies that can enhance student learning and engagement. With this aim, we developed an online, third year web-development course, and redesigned its existing F2F version. This study focuses on examining the course strategies utilized in the two versions of of the course, and how students' learning and engagement vary between these two offerings. In Fall 2019, we conducted experimental research with pre- and post-tests to collect data from these two sections. The participants of the study include 51 out of 103 online students, and 38 out of 72 F2F students. We identified course strategies that were more valuable to one group versus the other, and both the sections. In terms of student learning, we found that there was no significant difference between these sections. Behavioral engagement measures depicted how the online and F2F students engaged within their courses, and how it is related to students' learning. We also found how the level of engagement varied in the online course according to the engagement factors that include performance, emotions, skills, and participation. The results of this study will inform online, F2F, and hybrid course design of upper-level CS courses.},

This requires a radical change of the role of the lecturers, as they are not knowledge transmitters anymore but learning facilitators. This role change has direct impact on the design of the in-class-meetings.Based on five years of experience with flipped classrooms for learning programming in bachelor computing programs and on an educational and organization analysis, we started to collect and describe patterns that help with improving various aspects of Flipped Classrooms. In this paper we describe five patterns that help with the design and execution of in-class meetings in a Flipped Classroom course.},

The method is increasingly being applied at university level. It has been implemented with varying approaches and guidelines, and a single unified process has not been described. In this article we compare existing literature to two case studies where flipped classroom was introduced to teaching. We discuss the lessons learned in these cases and present recommendations based on our experiences. Flipping the classroom has been found to be more efficient than traditional lecture-exercises method and the findings in this study support this. Therefore we recommend teachers to explore the possibility of utilizing the flipped classroom method in their courses.},

Synthesizing multiple types of qualitative data, this study finds that the flexibility of HyFlex learning mode can satisfy students’ various needs. It also examines the advantages of the HyFlex learning: improving participation and equity. However, successful HyFlex learning also needs to face challenges on technology and how students deal with technical issues.
